These are scripts I used to solve some of the challenges

**getAllTextFromDungeonOnline.exp**

This expect script will connect to the dungeon server and retrieve all text from the game.
Best to run as

```
expect getAllTextFromDungeonOnline.exp > someTextFile
```

Then read the text file

**getTweets.py**

This python script can be used to get all of the Twitter clues from santawclaus. You'll need to provide some information in the script to get started.

**Get your own credentials from Twitter**

```
#Twitter API credentials
consumer_key = ""
consumer_secret = ""
access_key = ""
access_secret = ""
```
