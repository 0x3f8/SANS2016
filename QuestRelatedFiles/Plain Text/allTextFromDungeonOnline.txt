Useful commands:

   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions
for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses
printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'
command restores long descriptions.
   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea
of what the game is about.
   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish
to continue playing.
   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.
   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.
   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.
   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.
   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.
   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.
   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.

Command abbreviations:

   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.
   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.
   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.

Containment:

   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can
be opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may
not be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object
which is in a container, the container must be open.  For you
to see such an object, the container must be either open or
transparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;
the number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their
sizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be
in your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program
will attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which
process may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers
can contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than
one level down.

Fighting:

   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when
attacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.
Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',
etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a
fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,
getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.
Strength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to
fight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details
should become apparent after a few melees or deaths.

Command parser:

   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.
For reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their
first six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing
'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also
creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-
tion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.

   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands
the following types of things--

   Actions:
	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.
	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,
	PUT DOWN, etc.

   Directions:
	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.
	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in
	only certain situations.

   Objects:
	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.

   Adjectives:
	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are
	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,
	DOORs, BUTTONs).

   Prepositions:
	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but
	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous
	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON
	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.
	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR
	WITH DEMON' won't parse.

   Sentences:
	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-
	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)
	can be placed on the same line.

   Ambiguity:
	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of
	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.
	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume
	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.
	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.

Welcome to Dungeon!

   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast
quantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.
In order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To
receive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy
case in the living room of the house.

   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects
which may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may
need sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,
since dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading
material is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it
is rumored to be useful.

   Recent adventurers report a new passage has been installed which 
leads to the North Pole and the lair of a mischevious elf who will trade
for secrets he holds that may aid your quest.
 
   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.
When you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a
certain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding
the object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure
safely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In
addition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated
with visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,
which you may do only twice.

   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who
likes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the
light of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure
rather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which
you have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste
he may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines
his take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-
ionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders
through and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).

You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the
dungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be
installed in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers
may gloat over them.

What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running
RSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.

Now let me see...
Well, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have
everything.

You are behind the white house.  In one corner of the house
there is a window which is #.

slightly ajar
GDT>Entry:    14

You are in the kitchen of the white house.  A table seems to have
been used recently for the preparation of food.  A passage leads to
the west, and a dark staircase can be seen leading upward.  To the
east is a small window which is #.
GDT>Entry:    15

You are in a dark and damp cellar with a narrow passageway leading
east, and a crawlway to the south.  To the west is the bottom of a
steep metal ramp which is unclimbable.
GDT>Entry:    22
dt
The door crashes shut, and you hear someone barring it.
GDT>Entry:    23

You are in a small room near the maze.  There are twisty
passages in the immediate vicinity.

You are in a long room on the south shore of a large reservoir.
GDT>Entry:    32
dt
You are in a long room, to the north of which was formerly a
reservoir.  However, with the water level lowered, there is merely
a wide stream running through the center of the room.
GDT>Entry:    33
dt
There is a western exit, a passageway south, and a steep pathway
climbing up along the edge of a cliff.
GDT>Entry:    34

You are on the reservoir.  Beaches can be seen north and south.
Upstream a small stream enters the reservoir through a narrow
cleft in the rocks.  The dam can be seen downstream.
GDT>Entry:    35
dt
You are on what used to be a large reservoir, but which is now a
large mud pile.  There are 'shores' to the north and south.
GDT>Entry:    36

You are in a large cavernous room, north of a large reservoir.
GDT>Entry:    37

There is a tunnel leaving the room to the north.
GDT>Entry:    39

You are in a large square room with tall ceilings.  There are exits
on the north, east, and west sides of the room.  On the south wall is
an enormous mirror which fills the entire wall.
GDT>Entry:    43

Unfortunately, you have managed to destroy it by your reckless
actions.

		BOOOOOOOOOM
GDT>Entry:    45

You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one
corner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes
dryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an
obscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the
label translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-
ulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4
inch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.

The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.

You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
GDT>Entry:    49
dt
In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who
is obviously deranged and holding his nose.
GDT>Entry:    50
dt
A deranged vampire bat (a reject from WUMPUS) swoops down
from the ceiling and lifts you away...
GDT>Entry:    51
dt
You are at the periphery of a large dome, which forms the ceiling
of another room below.  Protecting you from a precipitous drop is a
wooden railing which circles the dome.
GDT>Entry:    52
dt
Hanging down from the railing is a rope which ends about ten feet
from the floor below.
GDT>Entry:    53
dt
I'm afraid that the leap you attempted has done you in.
GDT>Entry:    54
dt
You are in a large room with a prominent doorway leading to a down
staircase.  To the west is a narrow twisting tunnel.  Above you is a
large dome painted with scenes depicting elvish hacking rites.  Up
around the edge of the dome (20 feet up) is a wooden railing.  In the
center of the room there is a white marble pedestal.
GDT>Entry:    55
dt
A large piece of rope descends from the railing above, ending some
five feet above your head.
GDT>Entry:    56
dt
You are in a circular room with passages off in eight directions.
GDT>Entry:    57
dt
Your compass needle spins wildly, and you cannot get your bearings.
GDT>Entry:    58
dt
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to cause you to be electrocuted.
I really don't know, but in any event, something has killed you.
GDT>Entry:    59
dt
You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:

	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."

The gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of
mangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some
hideous fate, can be heard.
GDT>Entry:    60
dt
The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your
attempts to pass.
GDT>Entry:    61
dt
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, chomper!"  Apparently, the voice thinks you
are an evil spirit and dismisses you from the land of the living.
GDT>Entry:    62
dt
You are not equipped for an exorcism.
GDT>Entry:    63
dt
There is a clap of thunder, and a voice echoes through the
cavern:  "Begone, fiends!"  The spirits, sensing the presense
of a greater power, flee through the walls.
GDT>Entry:    64
dt
You have entered the land of the living dead, a large desolate
room.  Although it is apparently uninhabited, you can hear the
sounds of thousands of lost souls weeping and moaning.  In
the east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous
adventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east
is an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
GDT>Entry:    65
dt
Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,
tastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
GDT>Entry:    66
dt
You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was
quite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths
to the north, south, east, and down.
GDT>Entry:    67
dt
The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can
be seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from
the lake.
GDT>Entry:    68
dt
It appears that the dam has been opened, since the water level behind
the dam is low and the sluice gate is open.  Water is rushing down-
stream through the gates.
GDT>Entry:    69
dt
There is a control panel here.  There is a large metal bolt on the
panel.  Above the bolt is a small green plastic bubble.
GDT>Entry:    70
dt
The green bubble is glowing.
GDT>Entry:    71
dt
The water level is now up to your ankles.
GDT>Entry:    72

The water level is now up to your shins.
GDT>Entry:    73

The water level is now up to your neck.
GDT>Entry:    78

The water level is now over your head.
GDT>Entry:    79
dt
The water level is now high in your lungs.
GDT>Entry:    80
dt
The room is full of water and cannot be entered.
GDT>Entry:    81
dt
I'm afraid you have done drowned yourself.
GDT>Entry:    82
dt
You hear a scream of anguish as you violate the robber's hideaway.
Using passages unknown to you, he rushes to its defense.
GDT>Entry:    83
dt
The thief gestures mysteriously, and the treasures in the room
suddenly vanish.
GDT>Entry:    84
dt
Something seems funny about the feel of the buoy.
GDT>Entry:    85
dt
Oh dear, you seem to have gone over Aragain Falls.  Not a very
smart thing to do, apparently.
GDT>Entry:    86
dt
You seem to be digging a hole here.
GDT>Entry:    87
dt
The hole is getting deeper, but that's about it.
GDT>Entry:    88
dt
You are surrounded by a wall of sand on all sides.
GDT>Entry:    89
dt
You can see a small statue in the sand.
GDT>Entry:    90
dt
The wall collapses, smothering you.
GDT>Entry:    91
dt
There is nothing to dig into here.
GDT>Entry:    92
dt
You are digging into a pile of bat guano.
GDT>Entry:    93
dt
You seem to be getting knee deep in guano.
GDT>Entry:    94
dt
You are covered with bat turds, cretin.
GDT>Entry:    95
dt
This is getting you nowhere.
GDT>Entry:    96
dt
You are at the top of Aragain Falls, an enormous waterfall with a
drop of about 450 feet.  The only path here is on the north end.
There is a man-sized barrel here which you could fit into.
GDT>Entry:    97
dt
A beautiful rainbow can be seen over the falls and to the east.
GDT>Entry:    98
dt
A solid rainbow spans the falls.
GDT>Entry:    99
dt
According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic
fields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards
of the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming
out of its ears, and it has stopped moving.
GDT>Entry:    100

You are on a wide ledge high into the volcano.  The rim of the
volcano is about 200 feet above, and there is a precipitous drop
below to the floor.
GDT>Entry:    101
dt
The way to the south is blocked by rubble.
GDT>Entry:    102

You are in a dusty old room which is virtually featureless, except
for an exit on the north side.
GDT>Entry:    105
dt
Imbedded in the far wall is a rusty old box.  It appears that
the box is somewhat damaged, since an oblong hole has been
chipped out of the front of it.
GDT>Entry:    106
dt
On the far wall is a rusty box, whose door has been blown off.
GDT>Entry:    107
dt
You are in a room with a low ceiling which is circular in shape.
There are exits to the east and southeast.
GDT>Entry:    108
dt
As you enter, your compass starts spinning wildly.
GDT>Entry:    109
dt
The ledge has collapsed and cannot be landed on.
GDT>Entry:    110
dt
The ledge collapses, giving you a narrow escape.
GDT>Entry:    111
dt
The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
GDT>Entry:    112
dt
The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.
GDT>Entry:    113
dt
The ledge collapses, probably as a result of the explosion.  A large
chunk of it, which is attached to the hook, drags you down to the
ground.  Fatally.
GDT>Entry:    114
dt
The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
GDT>Entry:    115
dt
You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of
that, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the
dungeon has collapsed.
GDT>Entry:    116
dt
The room trembles and 50,000 pounds of rock fall on you,
turning you into a pancake.
GDT>Entry:    117
dt
The house shakes, and the ceiling of the room you're in collapses,
turning you into a pancake.
GDT>Entry:    118
dt
A volcano gnome seems to walk straight out of the wall and says,
"I have a very busy appointment schedule and little time to waste on
trespassers, but for a very small fee, I'll show you the way out."
You notice that the gnome is nervously glancing at his watch.
GDT>Entry:    119
dt
Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears
seeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible
voice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You
have persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them
all.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"
He then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a
wisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.
When the smoke clears, the phrase "send email to peppermint@northpolewonderland.com" 
is all that remains.

The lamp has smashed into the floor, and the light has gone out.
GDT>Entry:    143
dt
The rug is too heavy to lift, but in trying to raise it you
notice an irregularity beneath it.
GDT>Entry:    144
dt
The rug is extremely heavy and cannot be carried.
GDT>Entry:    145
dt
With a great effort, the rug is moved to one side of the room.
With the rug moved, the dusty cover of a closed trap door appears.
GDT>Entry:    146
dt
Having moved the carpet previously, you find it impossible
to move it again.
GDT>Entry:    147
dt
You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
GDT>Entry:    148
dt
Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
GDT>Entry:    149
dt
The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an
an appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.
GDT>Entry:    150
dt
Now you've done it.  It seems that the brick has other properties
than weight, namely the ability to blow you to smithereens.
GDT>Entry:    151
dt
There is an explosion nearby.
GDT>Entry:    152
dt
The wire rapidly burns into nothing.
GDT>Entry:    153
dt
The match has gone out.
GDT>Entry:    154
dt
The lamp appears to be getting dimmer.
GDT>Entry:    155
dt
The lamp is dying.
GDT>Entry:    156
dt
The candles grow short.
GDT>Entry:    157
dt
The candles are very short.
GDT>Entry:    158
dt
The leaves burn, and the neighbors start to complain.
GDT>Entry:    159
dt
The sight of someone carrying a pile of burning leaves so offends
the neighbors that they come over and put you out.
GDT>Entry:    160
dt
As you pick up the rusty knife, your sword gives a single pulse
of blinding blue light.
GDT>Entry:    161
dt
As the knife approaches its victim, your mind is submerged by an
overmastering will.  Slowly, your hand turns, until the rusty blade
is an inch from your neck.  The knife seems almost to sing as it
savagely cuts your throat.
GDT>Entry:    162
dt
A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration
of the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on
all of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of
the living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
GDT>Entry:    163
dt
There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.
GDT>Entry:    164
dt
There is an ugly person staring at you.
GDT>Entry:    165
dt
The mirror is broken into many pieces.
GDT>Entry:    166
dt
Nobody but a greedy surgeon would allow you to attempt that trick.
GDT>Entry:    167
dt
You have broken the mirror.  I hope you have a seven years supply of
good luck available.
GDT>Entry:    168
dt
Haven't you done enough already?
GDT>Entry:    169
dt
The torch hits the glacier and explodes into a great ball of flame,
devouring the glacier.  The water from the melting glacier rushes
downstream, carrying the torch with it.  In place of the glacier,
there is a passageway leading west.
GDT>Entry:    170
dt
The melting glacier seems to have carried the torch away, leaving
you in the dark.
GDT>Entry:    171
dt
The glacier is unmoved by your ridiculous attempt.
GDT>Entry:    172
dt
Part of the glacier melts, drowning you under a torrent of water.
GDT>Entry:    173
dt
burned out ivory torch
GDT>Entry:    174
dt
There is a burned out ivory torch here.
GDT>Entry:    175
dt
The basket is raised to the top of the shaft.
GDT>Entry:    176
dt
The basket is lowered to the bottom of the shaft.
GDT>Entry:    177
dt
The cage is securely fastened to the iron chain.
GDT>Entry:    178
dt
You seem unable to affect these spirits.
GDT>Entry:    179
dt
How can you attack a spirit with material objects?
GDT>Entry:    180
dt
The book is open to page 569.
GDT>Entry:    181
dt
As hard as you try, the book cannot be closed.
GDT>Entry:    182
dt
A booming voice says, "Wrong, cretin!", and you notice that you
have turned into a pile of dust.
GDT>Entry:    183
dt
I'm afraid that you have run out of matches.
GDT>Entry:    184
dt
One of the matches starts to burn.
GDT>Entry:    185
dt
The match is out.
GDT>Entry:    186
dt
The tube refuses to accept anything.
GDT>Entry:    187
dt
The cyclops yawns and stares at the thing that woke him.
GDT>Entry:    188
dt
The cyclops, tired of all your games and trickery, eats you.
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  Just like mom used to make 'em."
GDT>Entry:    189
dt
The cyclops says, "Mmm mmm!  I love hot peppers!  But oh, could I use
a drink.  Perhaps I could drink the blood of that thing."  From the
gleam in his eye, it could be surmised that you are 'that thing'.
GDT>Entry:    190
dt
The cyclops looks tired and quickly falls fast asleep (what did you
put in that drink, anyway?).
GDT>Entry:    191
dt
The cyclops is apparently not thirsty at the moment and refuses
your generous gesture.
GDT>Entry:    192
dt
The cyclops may be hungry, but there is a limit.
GDT>Entry:    193
dt
The cyclops is not so stupid as to eat that!
GDT>Entry:    194
dt
The cyclops seems somewhat agitated.
GDT>Entry:    195
dt
The cyclops appears to be getting more agitated.
GDT>Entry:    196
dt
The cyclops is moving about the room, looking for something.
GDT>Entry:    197
dt
The cyclops was looking for salt and pepper.  I think he is gathering
condiments for his upcoming snack.
GDT>Entry:    198
dt
The cyclops is moving toward you in an unfriendly manner.
GDT>Entry:    199
dt
You have two choices:  1. Leave  2. Become dinner.
GDT>Entry:    200
dt
Your actions don't appear to be doing much harm to the cyclops, but
they do not exactly lower your insurance premiums, either.
GDT>Entry:    201
dt
The cyclops ignores all injuries to his body with a shrug.
GDT>Entry:    202
dt
The cyclops is rather heavy and doesn't take kindly to being grabbed.
GDT>Entry:    203
dt
You cannot tie the cyclops, although he is fit to be tied.
GDT>Entry:    204
dt
Realizing just in time that you'd be stabbed in the back if you
tried to take the chalice, you return to the fray.
GDT>Entry:    205
dt
Congratulations!  Unlike the other vandals, who merely stole the
artist's masterpieces, you have destroyed one.
GDT>Entry:    206

worthless piece of canvas
GDT>Entry:    207

There is a worthless piece of canvas here.
GDT>Entry:    208

With great effort, you open the window far enough to allow passage.
GDT>Entry:    209
dt
The window closes (more easily than it opened).
GDT>Entry:    210
dt
The bolt won't turn with your best effort.
GDT>Entry:    211
dt
The sluice gates open, and water pours through the dam.
GDT>Entry:    212
dt
The sluice gates close, and water starts to collect behind the dam.
GDT>Entry:    213
dt
You can't do that!
GDT>Entry:    214
dt
The grating is locked.
GDT>Entry:    215
dt
The grating opens to reveal trees above you.
GDT>Entry:    216
dt
The grating opens.
GDT>Entry:    217
dt
The grating is unlocked.
GDT>Entry:    218
dt
The door reluctantly opens to reveal a rickety staircase descending
into darkness.
GDT>Entry:    219
dt
The door swings shut and closes.
GDT>Entry:    220
dt
The door is locked from above.
GDT>Entry:    221
dt
The door cannot be opened.
GDT>Entry:    222
dt
You cannot burn this door.
GDT>Entry:    223
dt
The door is invulnerable.
GDT>Entry:    224
dt
You cannot damage this door.
GDT>Entry:    225
dt
The door is still under warranty.
GDT>Entry:    226
dt
The machine comes to life (figuratively) with a dazzling display
of colored lights and bizarre noises.  After a few moments, the
excitement fades.
GDT>Entry:    227
dt
The machine doesn't seem to want to do anything.
GDT>Entry:    228
dt
A force keeps you from taking the bodies.
GDT>Entry:    229
dt
The voice of the guardian of the dungeon booms out from the darkness,
"Your disrespect has cost you your life!" and places your head on a pole.
GDT>Entry:    230
dt
The lights within the room shut off.
GDT>Entry:    231
dt
The lights within the room come on.
GDT>Entry:    232
dt
Click.
GDT>Entry:    233
dt
There is a rumbling sound, and a stream of water appears to burst
from the east wall of the room (apparently, a leak has occurred
in a pipe).
GDT>Entry:    234
dt
The blue button appears to be jammed.
GDT>Entry:    235
dt
The boat must be on the ground to be inflated.
GDT>Entry:    236
dt
The boat inflates and appears seaworthy.
GDT>Entry:    237
dt
You don't have enough lung power to inflate it.
GDT>Entry:    238
dt
This boat will not inflate since some cretin put a hole in it.
GDT>Entry:    239
dt
Well done.  The boat is repaired.
GDT>Entry:    240
dt
There is a hissing sound and the boat deflates.
GDT>Entry:    241
dt
The boat deflates.
GDT>Entry:    242
dt
You can't deflate the boat while you're in it.
GDT>Entry:    243
dt
The boat must be on the ground to be deflated.
GDT>Entry:    244
dt
Very good.
GDT>Entry:    245
dt
The rainbow seems to have become somewhat run of the mill.
GDT>Entry:    246
dt
Suddenly, the rainbow appears to become solid and, I venture,
walkable (I think the giveaway was the stairs and bannister).
GDT>Entry:    247
dt
The structural integrity of the rainbow seems to have declined
precipitously, leaving you about 450 feet in the air, supported
by water vapor.
GDT>Entry:    248
dt
The ballon is fastened to the hook.
GDT>Entry:    249
dt
The balloon is not tied to anything.
GDT>Entry:    250
dt
The wire falls off the hook.
GDT>Entry:    251
dt
The box is imbedded in the wall.
GDT>Entry:    252
dt
What do you expect, BOOM?
GDT>Entry:    253
dt
The box has no door!
GDT>Entry:    254
dt
The box is rusted and will not open.
GDT>Entry:    255
dt
The box is not open, chomper!
GDT>Entry:    256
dt
The wire starts to burn.
GDT>Entry:    257
dt
"Thank you very much," he says.  "I don't believe I've seen a
# as beautiful.  Follow me."  A door appears on the west end
of the ledge.  Through the door, you can see a narrow chimney
sloping downward.  The gnome moves quickly, and he disappears
from sight.
GDT>Entry:    258
dt
"That wasn't quite what I had in mind", he says, crunching
the # in his rock hard hands.
GDT>Entry:    259
dt
The gnome appears increasingly nervous.
GDT>Entry:    260
dt
Although the implementers are gone, they foresaw that some cretin
would tamper with their remains.  Therefore, they took steps to
prevent this.
GDT>Entry:    261
dt
Unfortunately, we've run out of poles.  Therefore, in punishment for
your transgression, we shall deprive you of all your valuables, and
of your life.
GDT>Entry:    262
dt
Congratulations!  You've managed to break all the bottles.  Fortunately
for your feet, they were made of magic glass and disappear immediately.
GDT>Entry:    263
dt
As you reach for the sphere, an iron cage falls from the ceiling
to entrap you.  To make matters worse, poisonous gas starts coming
into the room.
GDT>Entry:    264
dt
As the robot reaches for sphere, an iron cage falls from the
ceiling.  The robot attempts to fend it off but is trapped below it.
Alas, the robot short circuits in his vain attempt to escape and
crushes the sphere beneath him as he falls to the floor.
GDT>Entry:    265
dt
There is a giant spark, and you are fried to a crisp.
GDT>Entry:    266
dt
Nothing seems to happen.
GDT>Entry:    267
dt
The whirring increases in intensity slightly.
GDT>Entry:    268
dt
The whirring decreases in intensity slightly.
GDT>Entry:    269
dt
A dull thump is heard in the distance.
GDT>Entry:    270
dt
The flask breaks into pieces.
GDT>Entry:    271
dt
Here noxious vapors prevent your entry.
GDT>Entry:    272
dt
Just before you pass out, you notice that the vapors from the
flask's contents are fatal.
GDT>Entry:    273
dt
Suddenly, the room appears to have become very large.
GDT>Entry:    274
dt
The only writing visible is a capital E.  The rest is too small to
be clearly visible.
GDT>Entry:    275
dt
You can't see through that!
GDT>Entry:    276
dt
The letters appear larger but are still too small to read.
GDT>Entry:    277
dt
The icing, now visible, says "EXPLODE".
GDT>Entry:    278
dt
The icing, now visible, says "EVAPORATE".
GDT>Entry:    279
dt
The icing, now visible, says "ENLARGE".
GDT>Entry:    280
dt
The pool of water evaporates, revealing a tin of rare spices.
GDT>Entry:    281
dt
The door to the room seems to be blocked by sticky orange rubble
from an explosion.  Probably some careless adventurer was playing
with blasting cakes.
GDT>Entry:    282
dt
You have been blasted to smithereens (whatever they are).
GDT>Entry:    283
dt
The room around you seems to be getting smaller.
GDT>Entry:    284
dt
The room seems to have become too small to hold you.  It seems
that the walls are not as compressable as your body, which is
more or less demolished.
GDT>Entry:    285
dt
The robot is injured (being of shoddy construction) and falls to the
floor in a pile of garbage, which disintegrates before your eyes.
GDT>Entry:    286
dt
How romantic!
GDT>Entry:    287
dt
If you must... Poof, you're dead!
GDT>Entry:    288
dt
The grue is a sinister, lurking presence in the dark places of the
earth.  Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable
appetite is tempered by its fear of light.  No grue has ever been
seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws
to tell the tale.
GDT>Entry:    289
dt
There is no grue here, but I'm sure there is at least one lurking in
the darkness nearby.  I wouldn't let my light go out if I were you!
GDT>Entry:    290
dt
The bucket rises and comes to a stop.
GDT>Entry:    291
dt
The bucket descends and comes to a stop.
GDT>Entry:    292
dt
You notice that the # has burned out, and that
the cloth bag is starting to deflate.
GDT>Entry:    293
dt
I hope you have more light than from a #.
GDT>Entry:    294
dt
I didn't realize that adventurers are stupid enough to light a
# in a room which reeks of coal gas.  Fortunately,
there is still justice in the world.
GDT>Entry:    295
dt
Oh, dear.  It appears that the smell coming from this room was coal
gas.  I would have thought twice about carrying a # in here.
GDT>Entry:    296
dt
There is now a puddle in the middle of the #.
GDT>Entry:    297
dt
The water leaks out of the # and evaporates immediately.
GDT>Entry:    298
dt
You won't melt it with a #.
GDT>Entry:    299
dt
The bolt can't be turned with your #.
GDT>Entry:    300
dt
It seems that a # won't do.
GDT>Entry:    301
dt
With a #?
GDT>Entry:    302
dt
The robot gladly takes the # and nods his headlike
appendage in thanks.
GDT>Entry:    303
dt
A #?  Surely you jest.
GDT>Entry:    304
dt
He who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is not fit for the
kingdom of winners.  In any case, 'BACK' doesn't work.
GDT>Entry:    305
dt
You'll have to speak up if you expect me to hear you.
GDT>Entry:    306
dt
I don't know how to do that.  I win in all cases.
GDT>Entry:    307
dt
At your service!
GDT>Entry:    308
dt
The Frobozz Company, Ltd., created, owns, and operates this dungeon.
GDT>Entry:    309
dt
Well, FOO, BAR, and BLETCH to you too!
GDT>Entry:    310
dt
It could very well be too late.
GDT>Entry:    311
dt
The dungeon is ALWAYS open (always room for one more).
GDT>Entry:    312
dt
Naturally!
GDT>Entry:    313
dt
AAAARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!
GDT>Entry:    314
dt
Very good.  Now you can go to the second grade.
GDT>Entry:    315
dt
Have you tried hopping around the dungeon, too?
GDT>Entry:    316
dt
Are you enjoying yourself?
GDT>Entry:    317
dt
Wheeeeee!
GDT>Entry:    318
dt
Do you expect me to applaud?
GDT>Entry:    319
dt
Such language in a high-class establishment like this!
GDT>Entry:    320
dt
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
GDT>Entry:    321
dt
It's not so bad.  You could have been killed already.
GDT>Entry:    322
dt
Tough shit, asshole.
GDT>Entry:    323
dt
Oh, dear.  Such language from a supposedly winning adventurer!
GDT>Entry:    324
dt
That word is henceforth replaced with DUNGEON.
GDT>Entry:    325
dt
I think you are taking this thing for granite.
GDT>Entry:    326
dt
Brief descriptions.
GDT>Entry:    327
dt
Maximum verbosity.
GDT>Entry:    328
dt
No long descriptions.
GDT>Entry:    329
dt
You can see:  A #.
GDT>Entry:    330
dt
Swimming is not allowed in this dungeon.
GDT>Entry:    331
dt
I don't really see how.
GDT>Entry:    332
dt
I think that swimming is best performed in water.
GDT>Entry:    333
dt
Perhaps it is your head that is swimming.
GDT>Entry:    334
dt
Wasn't he an Indian?
GDT>Entry:    335
dt
I didn't think you would really try to go over the falls in a
barrel.  It seems that some 450 feet below, you were met by a number
of unfriendly rocks and boulders, causing your immediate demise.
GDT>Entry:    336
dt
Wasn't he a sailor?
GDT>Entry:    337
dt
The cyclops, hearing the name of his deadly nemesis, flees the room
by knocking down the wall on the north side of the room.
GDT>Entry:    338
dt
There is a clap of thunder and the east door opens.
GDT>Entry:    339
dt
Well what?
GDT>Entry:    340
dt
If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
GDT>Entry:    341
dt
Nothing happens.
GDT>Entry:    342
dt
I don't really know how to do that.
GDT>Entry:    343
dt
Do you wish to leave the game?
GDT>Entry:    344
dt
Underneath the pile of leaves is a grating.
GDT>Entry:    345
dt
Underneath the rug is a closed trap door.
GDT>Entry:    346
dt
Hello.
GDT>Entry:    347
dt
Good day.
GDT>Entry:    348
dt
Nice weather we've been having lately.
GDT>Entry:    349
dt
Goodbye.
GDT>Entry:    350
dt
Here, nothing happens.
GDT>Entry:    351
dt
Nothing happens here.
GDT>Entry:    352
dt
I think that phrase is getting a bit worn out.
GDT>Entry:    353
dt
You seem to be repeating yourself.
GDT>Entry:    354
dt
The # bows his head to you in greeting.
GDT>Entry:    355
dt
I think that only schizophrenics say hello to a #.
GDT>Entry:    356
dt
It is impossible to read in the dark.
GDT>Entry:    357
dt
How does one look through a #?
GDT>Entry:    358
dt
How can I read a #?
GDT>Entry:    359
dt
How, exactly, do I ring that?
GDT>Entry:    360
dt
Ding, dong.
GDT>Entry:    361
dt
I'm not sure that a # can be melted.
GDT>Entry:    362
dt
If you wish, but I can't understand why.
GDT>Entry:    363
dt
Dental hygiene is highly recommended, but I'm not sure what
you want to brush them with.
GDT>Entry:    364
dt
A nice idea, but with a #?
GDT>Entry:    365
dt
Well, you seem to have been brushing your teeth with some sort of
glue.  As a result, your mouth gets glued together with your nose,
and you die of respiratory failure.
GDT>Entry:    366
dt
Unfortunately, the troll can't hear you.
GDT>Entry:    367
dt
Inflating it further would probably burst it.
GDT>Entry:    368
dt
How can you inflate that?
GDT>Entry:    369
dt
Come on, now!

Playing in this way with a # #.

Fiddling with a # #.
GDT>Entry:    382

Pushing the # #.
GDT>Entry:    383
dt
I don't think so.
GDT>Entry:    384
dt
This cannot be tied, so it cannot be untied!
GDT>Entry:    385
dt
How can you tie that to anything?
GDT>Entry:    386
dt
You can't tie the # to that.
GDT>Entry:    387
dt
You could certainly never tie the # with that!
GDT>Entry:    388
dt
The # struggles and you cannot tie him up.
GDT>Entry:    389
dt
Why would you tie up a #?
GDT>Entry:    390
dt
You can't turn that.
GDT>Entry:    391
dt
You certainly can't turn it with a #.
GDT>Entry:    392

Digging with the # is slow and tedious.
GDT>Entry:    393

Digging with a # is silly.
GDT>Entry:    394
dt
I don't think that anybody is home.
GDT>Entry:    395
dt
Why knock on a #?
GDT>Entry:    396
dt
It sounds like there is something inside the #.
GDT>Entry:    397
dt
The contents of the # spill out.
GDT>Entry:    398

I can't get to that to move it.
GDT>Entry:    399

You can't move the #.
GDT>Entry:    400

You can't turn that on.
GDT>Entry:    401

It is already on.
GDT>Entry:    402

You can't turn that off.
GDT>Entry:    403

It is already off.
GDT>Entry:    404

The # is now on.
GDT>Entry:    405

The # is now off.
GDT>Entry:    406

It is now pitch black.
GDT>Entry:    407

You must tell me how to do that to a #.
GDT>Entry:    408
dt
The # cannot be opened.
GDT>Entry:    409
dt
Opened.
GDT>Entry:    410

Opening the # reveals:
GDT>Entry:    411

The # cannot be closed.
GDT>Entry:    412

It is already open.
GDT>Entry:    413

It is already closed.
GDT>Entry:    414
dt
Closed.
GDT>Entry:    415
dt
There is a # here.
GDT>Entry:    416
dt
You are carrying a #.
GDT>Entry:    417
dt
It is in the #, which is in the room.
GDT>Entry:    418
dt
It is in the #, which you are carrying.
GDT>Entry:    419
dt
Time passes...
GDT>Entry:    420
dt
The # must be on the ground to be boarded.
GDT>Entry:    421
dt
I suppose you have a theory on boarding a #.
GDT>Entry:    422
dt
You are already in the #, cretin!
GDT>Entry:    423
dt
You are now in the #.
GDT>Entry:    424
dt
You aren't in that!
GDT>Entry:    425
dt
You realize, just in time, that disembarking here would probably
be fatal.
GDT>Entry:    426
dt
You are on your own feet again.
GDT>Entry:    427
dt
You can't go there without a vehicle.
GDT>Entry:    428
dt
You can't go there in a #.
GDT>Entry:    429
dt
I see nothing special about the #.
GDT>Entry:    430
dt
It is pitch dark.  You are likely to be eaten by a grue.
GDT>Entry:    431
dt
You are in the #.
GDT>Entry:    432
dt
The # has died.
GDT>Entry:    433
dt
The troll, disarmed, cowers in terror, pleading for his life in
the guttural tongue of the trolls.
GDT>Entry:    434
dt
The troll, now worried about this encounter, recovers his
bloody axe.
GDT>Entry:    435
dt
An unconscious troll is sprawled on the floor.  All passages out
of the room are open.
GDT>Entry:    436
dt
A nasty-looking troll, brandishing a bloody axe, blocks all passages
out of the room.
GDT>Entry:    437
dt
The troll stirs, quickly resuming a fighting stance.
GDT>Entry:    438
dt
The troll spits in your face, saying "Better luck next time".
GDT>Entry:    439
dt
The troll laughs at your puny gesture.
GDT>Entry:    440
dt
The troll, who is remarkably coordinated, catches the #
GDT>Entry:    441
dt
The troll, who is not overly proud, graciously accepts the gift
GDT>Entry:    442
dt
and not having the most discriminating tastes, gleefully eats it.
GDT>Entry:    443
dt
and being for the moment sated, throws it back.  Fortunately, the
troll has poor control, and the knife falls on the floor.  He does
not look pleased.
GDT>Entry:    444
dt
Sadly, a # can't be put in a #.
GDT>Entry:    445
dt
You can't take the #.
GDT>Entry:    446
dt
Aren't you forgetting something?
GDT>Entry:    447
dt
That would be a good trick.
GDT>Entry:    448
dt
The # is too big to jump over.
GDT>Entry:    449
dt
You should have looked before you leaped.
GDT>Entry:    450
dt
I'm afraid that leap was a bit much for your weak frame.
GDT>Entry:    451
dt
In the movies, your life would be passing in front of your eyes.
GDT>Entry:    452
dt
Geronimo...
GDT>Entry:    453
dt
I don't think that the # would agree with you.
GDT>Entry:    454
dt
I think you should get that first.
GDT>Entry:    455
dt
Thank you very much.  It really hit the spot.
GDT>Entry:    456
dt
How can I drink that?
GDT>Entry:    457
dt
I'd like to, but I can't get to that.
GDT>Entry:    458
dt
Thank you very much.  I was rather thirsty, probably from all
this talking.
GDT>Entry:    459
dt
The # catches fire.
GDT>Entry:    460
dt
Unfortunately, you were holding it at the time.
GDT>Entry:    461
dt
You don't have that.
GDT>Entry:    462
dt
The # catches fire and is consumed.
GDT>Entry:    463
dt
I don't think you can burn a #.
GDT>Entry:    464
dt
It doesn't seem to work.
GDT>Entry:    465

Can you unlock a grating with a #?

Munging a # #.

GDT>Entry:    469

There is nothing here to attack.
GDT>Entry:    470
dt
I've known strange people, but attacking a #?
GDT>Entry:    471
dt
with your bare hands is suicidal
GDT>Entry:    472
dt
with that is very self-destructive
GDT>Entry:    473
dt
You are in perfect health.
GDT>Entry:    474
dt
You have a light wound.
GDT>Entry:    475

You have a serious wound.
GDT>Entry:    476

You have several wounds.
GDT>Entry:    477
dt
You have serious wounds.
GDT>Entry:    478

You are at death's door.
GDT>Entry:    479
dt
You can be killed by one more light wound.
GDT>Entry:    480
dt
You can be killed by a serious wound.
GDT>Entry:    481
dt
You can survive one serious wound.
GDT>Entry:    482
dt
You are strong enough to take several wounds.
GDT>Entry:    483

You have been killed once.
GDT>Entry:    484

You have been killed twice.

Annoyed to be left unarmed in such an obviously dangerous
neighborhood, the thief slips off into the shadows.
GDT>Entry:    499
dt
The robber, somewhat surprised by this turn of events, nimbly
recovers his stilletto.
GDT>Entry:    500
dt
His booty remains.
GDT>Entry:    501
dt
As the thief dies, the power of his magic decreases, and his
treasures reappear:  A #.
GDT>Entry:    502
dt
  A #.
GDT>Entry:    503
dt
There is a suspicious-looking individual, holding a bag, leaning
against one wall.  He is armed with a vicious-looking stilletto.
GDT>Entry:    504
dt
There is a suspicious-looking individual lying unconscious on the
ground.  His bag and stilletto seem to have vanished.
GDT>Entry:    505
dt
The robber revives, briefly feigning continued unconsciousness, and
when he sees his moment, scrambles away from you.
GDT>Entry:    506
dt
Once you got him, what would you do with him?
GDT>Entry:    507
dt
You missed.  The thief makes no attempt to take the knife, although
it would be a fine addition to the collection in his bag.  He does
seem angered by your attempt.
GDT>Entry:    508
dt
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees.
GDT>Entry:    509
dt
You evidently frightened the robber, although you missed him.  He flees,
but the contents of his bag fall on the floor.
GDT>Entry:    510
dt
Your proposed victim suddenly recovers consciousness.
GDT>Entry:    511
dt
The thief seems rather offended by your offer.  Do you think he's as
stupid as you are?
GDT>Entry:    512
dt
The thief places the # in his bag and thanks you politely.
GDT>Entry:    513
dt
The candles are not lit.
GDT>Entry:    514
dt
The flame is extinguished.
GDT>Entry:    515
dt
Alas, there's not much left of the candles.  Certainly not enough to
burn.
GDT>Entry:    516
dt
With what?
GDT>Entry:    517
dt
The candles are lit.
GDT>Entry:    518
dt
The candles are already lit.
GDT>Entry:    519
dt
You have to light them with something that's burning, you know.
GDT>Entry:    520
dt
You realize just in time that the candles are already lit.
GDT>Entry:    521
dt
The heat from the torch is so intense that the candles are vaporized.
GDT>Entry:    522
dt
Oh, no!  You walked into the slavering fangs of a lurking grue.
GDT>Entry:    523
dt
Oh, no!  A fearsome grue slithered into the room and devoured you.
GDT>Entry:    524
dt
You can't go that way.
GDT>Entry:    525
dt
The # is closed.
GDT>Entry:    526
dt
I can't reach that.
GDT>Entry:    527
dt
You aren't carrying that.
GDT>Entry:    528
dt
Dropped.
GDT>Entry:    529
dt
Thrown.
GDT>Entry:    530
dt
You watch as the balloon slowly lands.
GDT>Entry:    531
dt
The balloon has landed.
GDT>Entry:    532
dt
You have landed, but the balloon did not survive.
GDT>Entry:    533
dt
You watch as the balloon slowly descends.
GDT>Entry:    534
dt
The balloon descends.
GDT>Entry:    535
dt
You hear a boom and notice that the balloon is falling to the ground.
GDT>Entry:    536
dt
Your balloon has hit the rim of the volcano, ripping the cloth and
causing you to drop 500 feet.  Did you get your flight insurance?
GDT>Entry:    537
dt
You watch as the balloon slowly ascends.
GDT>Entry:    538
dt
The balloon ascends.
GDT>Entry:    539
dt
You watch as the balloon slowly floats away.  It seems to be ascending,
due to its light load.
GDT>Entry:    540
dt
The balloon leaves the ledge.
GDT>Entry:    541
dt
You watch as the balloon slowly lifts off.
GDT>Entry:    542
dt
The balloon slowly rises from the ground.
GDT>Entry:    543
dt
The cloth bag is draped over the side.
GDT>Entry:    544
dt
The balloon is inflated, and there is a # burning
in the receptacle.
GDT>Entry:    545
dt
The balloon is tied to the hook.
GDT>Entry:    546
dt
I'm afraid you can't control the balloon in that way.
GDT>Entry:    547
dt
You are tied to the ledge.
GDT>Entry:    548
dt
You don't really want to hold a burning #.
GDT>Entry:    549
dt
The receptacle is already occupied.
GDT>Entry:    550
dt
The # burns inside the receptacle.
GDT>Entry:    551
dt
The balloon inflates as it fills with hot air.
GDT>Entry:    552
dt
Not likely.
GDT>Entry:    553
dt
An interesting idea, but...
GDT>Entry:    554
dt
A valiant attempt.
GDT>Entry:    555
dt
You can't be serious.
GDT>Entry:    556
dt
Not a prayer.
GDT>Entry:    557
dt
You already have it.
GDT>Entry:    558
dt
Your load is too heavy.  You will have to leave something behind.
GDT>Entry:    559
dt
Taken.
GDT>Entry:    560
dt
Nice try.
GDT>Entry:    561
dt
I can't do that.
GDT>Entry:    562
dt
I can't reach inside.
GDT>Entry:    563
dt
How can you do that?
GDT>Entry:    564
dt
The # is already in the #.
GDT>Entry:    565
dt
It won't fit.
GDT>Entry:    566
dt
I can't reach the #.
GDT>Entry:    567
dt
The cage shakes and is hurled across the room.
GDT>Entry:    568
dt
"I am sorry but that action is difficult in the absense of a mouth."
GDT>Entry:    569
dt
"My vision is not that good without eyes."
GDT>Entry:    570

"I am only a stupid robot and cannot perform that command."
GDT>Entry:    571
dt
ECHO
The acoustics of the room change subtly.
GDT>Entry:    572
dt
Almost as soon as the # breathes his last, a cloud of
sinister black smoke envelops him, and when the fog lifts, the
carcass has disappeared.
GDT>Entry:    573

The # contains:

By some miracle of elven technology, you have managed to
stop the leak in the dam.
GDT>Entry:    578

You are empty handed.

It is too dark in here to see.
GDT>Entry:    580

#:
GDT>Entry:    581

I could't find anything.
GDT>Entry:    582

I couldn't find any valuables.
GDT>Entry:    583
dt
Someone carrying a large bag is casually leaning against one of the
walls here.  He does not speak, but it is clear from his aspect that
the bag will be taken only over his dead body.
GDT>Entry:    584
dt
Your opponent, determining discretion to be the better part of
valor, decides to terminate this little contretemps.  With a rueful
nod of his head, he steps backward into the gloom and disappears.
GDT>Entry:    585
dt
The holder of the large bag just left, looking disgusted.
Fortunately, he took nothing.
GDT>Entry:    586
dt
A 'lean and hungry' gentleman just wandered through.  Finding
nothing of value, he left disgruntled.
GDT>Entry:    587
dt
A seedy-looking individual with a large bag just wandered through
the room.  On the way, he quietly abstracted all valuables from the
room and from your possession, mumbling something about, "Do unto
others before...".
GDT>Entry:    588
dt
The other occupant (he of the large bag), finding nothing of value,
left disgusted.
GDT>Entry:    589
dt
The other occupant just left carrying his large bag.  You may not
have noticed that he robbed you blind first.
GDT>Entry:    590
dt
Off in the distance you hear someone saying, "My, I wonder what this
fine # is doing here?"
GDT>Entry:    591
dt
You are still recovering from the last blow, so your attack is
ineffective.
GDT>Entry:    592
dt
Attacking a dead # is pointless.
GDT>Entry:    593
dt
Well, you really did it that time.  Is suicide painless?
GDT>Entry:    594
dt
The # slowly regains his feet.
GDT>Entry:    595
dt
The unconscious # cannot defend himself:  he dies.
GDT>Entry:    596
dt
It appears that the last blow was too much for you.  I'm afraid
that you are dead.
GDT>Entry:    597

Saved.

Save and restore are disabled.

Your save file is obsolete and cannot be restored.
GDT>Entry:    601

I don't understand that.
GDT>Entry:    602

You cannot talk to that!
GDT>Entry:    603

You cannot talk through another person.
GDT>Entry:    604

Please input the entire command again.
GDT>Entry:    605

Fortunately, you still have a #.
GDT>Entry:    606
dt
You are in a room with an exit on the west side, and a staircase
leading up.
GDT>Entry:    607
dt
A cyclops, who looks prepared to eat horses (much less mere
adventurers), blocks the staircase.  From his state of health
and the bloodstains on the wall, you gather that he is not very
friendly, though he likes people.
GDT>Entry:    608
dt
The cyclops is standing in the corner, eyeing you closely.  I don't
think he likes you very much.  He looks extremely hungry, even for
a cyclops.
GDT>Entry:    609
dt
The cyclops, having eaten the hot peppers, appears to be gasping.
His enflamed tongue protrudes from his man-sized mouth.
GDT>Entry:    610
dt
The cyclops, perhaps affected by a drug in your drink, is sleeping
blissfully at the foot of the stairs.
GDT>Entry:    611

On the north of the room is a wall which used to be solid, but which
now has a cyclops-shaped hole in it.

Too many objects.

I can't see one here.
GDT>Entry:    619

Which one do you mean?
GDT>Entry:    620

I can't reach that from inside the #.
GDT>Entry:    621

What should I do with the #?
GDT>Entry:    622

Huh?
GDT>Entry:    623

You must supply a direct object.

A metallic voice says, "Hello, Intruder!  Your unauthorized presence

An epicene Gnome of Zurich, wearing a three-piece suit and carrying a
safety deposit box, materializes in the room.  "You seem to have
forgotten to deposit your valuables," he says, tapping the lid of the
box impatiently.  "We don't usually allow customers to use the boxes
here, but we can make this ONE exception, I suppose..."  He looks
askance at you over his wire-rimmed bifocals.
GDT>Entry:    638

From out of the greenery flies a lovely song bird.  It perches on a
limb just over your head and opens its beak to sing.  As it does so,
a beautiful brass bauble drops from its mouth, bounces off the top
of your head, and lands glimmering in the grass.  As the canary winds
down, the song bird flies away.

You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
GDT>Entry:    689

foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole is resting on
the stone floor.

through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The

attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing #.

parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer

window barred with iron.  The door is #.

You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "#".

   As you gleefully examine your new-found riches, the dungeon
master himself materializes beside you and says, "Now that you have
solved all the mysteries of the dungeon, it is time for you to assume
your rightfully-earned place in the scheme of things.  Long have I
waited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you
lightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.
You feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a
moment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the
treasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist
and disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.

Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat
disoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.
As you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you
and says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of
Zork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the
future, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time
transport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say
