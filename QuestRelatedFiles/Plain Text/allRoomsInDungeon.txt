You are in what appears to have been the maintenance room for flood
control dam #3, judging by the assortment of tool chests around the
room.  Apparently, this room has been ransacked recently, for most of
the valuable equipment is gone.  On the wall in front of you is a
panel of buttons, which are labelled in EBCDIC.  However, they are of
different colors:  blue, yellow, brown, and red.  The doors to this

Strangely enough, nothing of value is hanging here.  At the north and

extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although

northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow.
Fortunately, my vision is better than average, and I can discern the
top of flood control dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the

Guardians of Zork, a military order of ancient lineage.  They are

You are inside a rectangular box of wood whose structure is rather
complicated.  Four sides and the roof are filled in, and the floor
is open.
   As you face the side opposite the entrance, two short sides of
carved and polished wood are to your left and right.  The left panel
is mahogany, the right pine.  The wall you face is red on its left
half and black on its right.  On the entrance side, the wall is white
opposite the red part of the wall it faces, and yellow opposite the
black section.  The painted walls are at least twice the length of
the unpainted ones.  The ceiling is painted blue.
   In the floor is a stone channel about six inches wide and a foot
deep.  The channel is oriented in a north-south direction.  In the
exact center of the room the channel widens into a circular
depression perhaps two feet wide.  Incised in the stone around this
area is a compass rose.
   Running from one short wall to the other at about waist height
is a wooden bar, carefully carved and drilled.  This bar is pierced
in two places.  The first hole is in the center of the bar (and thus
in the center of the room).  The second is at the left end of the room
(as you face opposite the entrance).  Through each hole runs a wooden
pole.
   The pole at the left end of the bar is short, extending about a
foot above the bar, and ends in a hand grip.  The pole has been
dropped into a hole carved in the stone floor.
   The long pole at the center of the bar extends from the ceiling
through the bar to the circular area in the stone channel.  The
bottom end of this pole has a T-bar a bit less than two feet long
attached to it.  On the T-bar is carved an arrow.  The arrow and
T-bar are pointing west.

You are in a large east-west corridor which opens out to a northern
parapet at its center.  You can see flames and smoke as you peer
towards the parapet.  The corridor turns south at its east and west
ends, and due south is a massive wooden door.  In the door is a small
window barred with iron.  The door is closed.

You are standing behind a stone retaining wall which rims a large
parapet overlooking a fiery pit.  It is difficult to see through the
smoke and flame which fills the pit, but it seems to be more or less
bottomless.  It also extends upwards out of sight.  The pit itself
is of roughly dressed stone and is circular in shape.  It is about
two hundred feet in diameter.  The flames generate considerable heat,
so it is rather uncomfortable standing here.
   There is an object here which looks like a sundial.  On it are
an indicator arrow and (in the center) a large button.  On the face
of the dial are numbers "one" through "eight".  The indicator points
to the number "one".

You are in a room of large size, richly appointed and decorated
in a style that bespeaks exquisite taste.  To judge from its
contents, it is the ultimate storehouse of the treasures of Zork.
   There are chests here containing precious jewels, mountains of
zorkmids, rare paintings, ancient statuary, and beguiling curios.
   In one corner of the room is a bookcase boasting such volumes
as "The History of the Great Underground Empire", "The Lives of
the Twelve Flatheads", "The Wisdom of the Implementers", and
other informative and inspiring works.
   On one wall is a completely annotated map of the Dungeon of
Zork, showing points of interest and various troves of treasure,
and indicating the locations of several superior scenic views.
   On the desk at the far end of the room may be found stock
certificates representing a controlling interest in FrobozzCo
International, the multinational conglomerate and parent company
of the Frobozz Magic Boat Co., etc.

You are in a small square room, in the middle of which is a recently
created hole through which you can barely discern the floor some ten
feet below.  It doesn't seem likely you could climb back up.  An 
extremely dark and narrow chimney leads up from a fireplace.  Although
you might be able to get up the chimney, it seems unlikely that you
could get back down. There are exits to the west and south.
There is a piece of paper on the ground here.

		Ask not what what the answer be,
		Without a trinket to satisfy me.
The elf is facing you keeping his back warmed by the fire.
