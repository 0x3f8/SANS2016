# SANS 2016 Holiday Hack Challenge

Welcome to my Repo on the 2016 Holiday Hack Challenge.

This year SANS outdid themselves once again.  This repo contains many of the files I encountered, scripts I created, and other goodies related to the challenge.

I have a lot of data to sift through as I decide what to add or redact.

At the least check out my submission for the entire challenge

As a bonus I made a walkthrough of the online game portion.  I mostly only cover relevant portions of the game.  Following the video should get you access to all of the quests and coins as well as the solution to the final challenge.
What it won'y get you is a step-by-step walkthrough of hacking the servers.  You'll have to read the submission to get those details.

Thanks again to the team at SANS for putting this together
